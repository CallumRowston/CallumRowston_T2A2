## R1 What this project solves

This project will provide a functioning webserver designed specifically for the canyoning community. It will provide a centralised place for information on Australian canyons and a direct forum for users to discuss particular canyons. Currently, information and discussions are spread over multiple websites and Facebook groups, making it difficult to find consistent information and resulting in many disjointed and confusing discussions where topics are not always immediately obvious and information can get easily lost in nested comments and over-filled news feeds.

## R2 Why this needs solving

Canyoning can be a dangerous and even fatal adventure pursuit without correct information. Most incidents in canyons are due to human error, whether through bad technique, inaction, or often poor planning. This project aims to make canyoning safer by:

1. Making basic information about specific canyons easily accessible, such as minimum rope length required, difficulty, and number of abseils.
2. Crowd sourcing information regarding conditions by providing the ability to comment on specific canyons to let others know of any changes such as high flow, rock and tree falls, and broken abseil anchors.
